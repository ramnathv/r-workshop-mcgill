> The best way to learn how to manipulate data is to start with a dataset of interest and work your way through interesting questions. 

We will use the `babynames` dataset to explore a set of interesting questions.

```{r}
bnames <- read_csv('../../data/babynames.csv.gz')
bnames
```


1. What are the most common starting and ending letters?
2. What are the most common unisex names?
3. What are the most consistent vs. trendy names?
4. What is the average length of a name by year?
5. How many babies have been named after GoT characters?
6. What names are popular in one gender and switched over time?

```{r}
bnames_french <- read_csv('../../data/babynames_french.csv.gz')
bnames_french
```


```{r}
write.csv(bnames_french, file = gzfile('../../data/babynames_french.csv.gz'), row.names = FALSE)
```


1. Bottom-Up: ABC, Words, Sentences ...
   
2. Top-Down: Write a book ->

## Tidy Data

1. Each row is an OBSERVATION (CASE, SAMPLE, EXAMPLE)
2. Each column is a VARIABLE (FEATURE)

## Manipulating Tidy Data

__Manipulate Rows__

1. Filter
2. Sorting

__Manipulating Columns__

1. Select

__Summarizing Data__

Verbs

__Rows__

1. filter
2. arrange

__Columns__

3. select
4. mutate

__Group__

1. group_by
2. summarize

```{r}
bnames
```


## What are the most common unisex names?

Venn Diagram
- Male
- Female
- Male & Female

1. [x] Group by name, sex
2. [x] Aggregate (count, sum)
3. [x] Calculate the pct of Males
4. [ ] 

> A name is considered unisex if there are at least 45% male and 45% female.

```{r}
PCT_THRESHOLD <- 0.49
bnames %>% 
  group_by(name, sex) %>% 
  summarize(nb_births = sum(n)) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(
    pct = nb_births / sum(nb_births),
    nb_births_total = sum(nb_births)
  ) %>% 
  # Remove all names that are ALL male or female
  filter(pct != 1) %>% 
  # Sort in decreasing order of total births by name
  arrange(desc(nb_births_total)) %>% 
  filter(sex == 'M') %>% 
  filter(pct >= PCT_THRESHOLD, pct <= 1- PCT_THRESHOLD)
```

## What are the most common starting and ending letters?

Male: M / R / S
Female: A / J / F

1. [ ] Extract the first and last letters of every name
2. [ ]
3.
4. 

```{r}
stringr::str_sub('Michael', 1, 1)
```


```{r dev = 'svg'}
bnames %>% 
  # filter(year >= 2000) %>% 
  mutate(
    first_letter = stringr::str_sub(name, 1, 1)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(first_letter, sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    nb_births = sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = first_letter, y = nb_births)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, ncol = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::unit_format(scale = 1e-6, unit = 'M')) +
  labs(
    x = 'First Letter',
    y = 'Number of Births',
    title = 'Most Common First Letters',
    caption = 'Source: Babynames Data from SSA US'
  )
```

# What is the trend of names starting with A / M?

```{r}
bnames %>% 
  mutate(
    first_letter = stringr::str_sub(name, 1, 1)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(first_letter, year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(nb_births = sum(n)) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  mutate(pct_births = nb_births / sum(nb_births)) %>% 
  filter(first_letter == 'J') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pct_births, color = sex)) +
  geom_line()
```

## What are the most consistent vs. trendy names?

## Figure out name lengths.

Are names becoming longer or shorter?

```{r}
bnames_french <- read_csv('../../data/babynames_french.csv.gz') %>% 
  rename(n = count)
bnames_french
```

```{r}
bnames %>% 
  mutate(nb_chars = nchar(name)) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    wtd_avg_nb_chars = sum(nb_chars * n) / sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = wtd_avg_nb_chars, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1990, linetype = 'dotted')
bnames_french %>% 
  mutate(nb_chars = nchar(name)) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    wtd_avg_nb_chars = sum(nb_chars * n) / sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = wtd_avg_nb_chars, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1958, linetype = 'dotted')
```

|year | sex | {nb_chars}

## What names are popular in one gender and switched over time?

```{r}
bnames %>% 
  filter(name == 'Jordan') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line()
```


```{r}
RATIO_THRESHOLD <- 3
bnames %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(nb_births_total = `M` + `F`) %>% 
  mutate(ratio_m_to_f = `M` / `F`) %>% 
  filter(min(ratio_m_to_f) < 1/RATIO_THRESHOLD, max(ratio_m_to_f) > RATIO_THRESHOLD) %>% 
  arrange(desc(nb_births_total))
  filter(name == "Leslie") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = M), color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(aes(y = `F`), color = 'darkgreen')
```

| name | year | M | F |

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  select(-prop) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(n = `M` + `F`) %>% 
  mutate(alpha = `M` / `F`) %>% 
  filter(min(alpha) < 1/5, max(alpha) > 5) %>% 
  filter(name == "Leslie") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = M)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `F`))
```
```


## Are names composed by two words (space in text).
   - How do we know if it is two or more word? (look for spaces, hyphens)
   
4. What is the average length of a name by year?
5. How many babies have been named after GoT characters?
