> The best way to learn how to manipulate data is to start with a dataset of interest and work your way through interesting questions. 

We will use the `babynames` dataset to explore a set of interesting questions.

```{r}
bnames <- read_csv('../../data/babynames.csv.gz')
bnames
```


1. What are the most common starting and ending letters?
2. What are the most common unisex names?
3. What are the most consistent vs. trendy names?
4. What is the average length of a name by year?
5. How many babies have been named after GoT characters?
6. What names are popular in one gender and switched over time?
