## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

> This is a quote

```{r cars}
linear_reg <- lm(mpg ~ wt + gear, data = mtcars)
summary(linear_reg)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{python}
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[x**2 for x in x]
```
